37 Articles describing the relationship between data types and concurrency(e.g. what is the type of a process?  when is a synchronization attempt between two processes "type correct"?  in a message-passing system is thereany notion of the types of messages?--i.e. any way to check that the senderof the message and the receiver are both treating the bit stream as someparticular type)
38 What is the type of a module?	(I don't want the entire literature onAbstract Data Types here, but I'm not sure how to phrase this to avoid it.I'm interested in questions about how one can check that a module "matches"contexts in which it is used.)
