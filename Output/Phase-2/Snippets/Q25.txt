is proposed. a system which integrates PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
feedback, the problems which adversely affect PERFORMANCE 
a software design AND EVALUATION system 
supervisory SYSTEMS, debugging, program maintenance, 
description is used as direct input to PERFORMANCE

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION, queueing models 
multiple processor SYSTEMS. issues considered include the impact OF cpu 
simple queueing models are used to study the PERFORMANCE tradeoffs OF 
on multiple processor SYSTEMS

system PERFORMANCE EVALUATION: survey AND appraisal 
the state OF the art OF system PERFORMANCE 
the central role OF measurement in PERFORMANCE 
presented as three levels OF approach to EVALUATION, 
OF PERFORMANCE; overhead AND cpu speed are placed in

rational extrapolation showed the best PERFORMANCE. 
a study comparing the PERFORMANCE OF several COMPUTER 
programs for integrating SYSTEMS OF ordinary 
procedure is described together with the EVALUATION

cost for usage OF the two COMPUTER SYSTEMS; however, 
on-line vs off-line PERFORMANCE, decision-making PERFORMANCE, 
a much higher level OF PERFORMANCE is attained by 
a PERFORMANCE level equal to that OF the batch 
two such SYSTEMS for what may well be the predominant user
